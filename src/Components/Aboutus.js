        <p>
          Welcome to the Intelligent Faculty Subject Allocation in Management
          System! Our platform uses advanced algorithms to efficiently match
          faculty to courses, making the allocation process more efficient and
          less time-consuming.

        <h2 className="a1">🧑‍🏫 Automated Allocation</h2>
        <p>
          Our system reduces manual effort by automatically assigning the most
          qualified faculty to subjects. This eliminates errors and streamlines
          the process, freeing up administrators for more strategic tasks.
        </p>
        <h2 className="a1">📊 Optimization</h2>
        <p>
          We ensure that faculty workload is balanced while maximizing the
          effectiveness of subject coverage. By considering available time,
          subject expertise, and experience, our system optimizes the allocation
          process.
        </p>

          leading to optimal resource utilization.
        </p>
        <h2 className="a1">👀Vision</h2>
